    "6.Multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated with each other. This correlation is a problem because independent variables should be independent. If the degree of correlation between variables is high enough, it can cause problems when you fit the model and interpret the results \n",
